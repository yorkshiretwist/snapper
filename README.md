# Monitor activities on a Windows PC

This app runs minimised and will take full-screen screenshots every few seconds. It also stores the process names and window titles for running processes. This is useful to monitor activities on a Windows PC.

There are a few configuration options:

* Number of seconds to pause between each snapshot (each image is compared the previous one, and only saved if it is different)
* The root folder to which to save snapshots
* A regular expression to use to ensure the app only runs for certain Windows users
